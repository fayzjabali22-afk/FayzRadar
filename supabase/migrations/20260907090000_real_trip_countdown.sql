-- The countdown both sides watch during a trip was not a countdown.
--
-- On the rider's screen it was one number, computed once:
--
--   etaSeconds: Math.max(4 * 60, Math.round((distanceKm || 4) * 85))
--
-- 85 seconds per kilometre of the TRIP, shown as "الكابتن يوصلك خلال" while the captain was
-- still driving over, and then as "الوقت المتبقي" once the trip had begun — the same number
-- for both, never recomputed at the transition. A 30 km trip therefore claimed the captain
-- was 42 minutes from a pickup point that might be two streets away.
--
-- Two things the client needed in order to show a real countdown did not exist on the server.
--
--
-- 1. NO ANCHOR FOR THE APPROACH
--
-- A countdown is `deadline - now`, and the deadline needs a start. ride_requests stamps
-- arrived_at, started_at, completed_at and cancelled_at — but nothing for when the rider
-- accepted the offer, which is exactly when the captain begins driving over.
--
-- With no server timestamp the client anchored on Date.now() at render, and buildActiveTrip
-- rebuilds its object on every realtime row: any column change restarted the countdown from
-- the top, and the rider's phone and the captain's never agreed.
--
--
-- 2. THE PICKUP ETA WAS THE LITERAL CONSTANT 5
--
--   INSERT INTO public.ride_offers (... eta_minutes ...)
--   VALUES (p_request_id, auth.uid(), p_offer_price, p_offer_price, 5, ...)
--                                                                  ^
--
-- Every offer ever submitted claimed five minutes. And submit_ride_offer already computes
-- the captain's real distance to the pickup — `distance_km`, for the 9 km radar guard — and
-- then throws it away.
--
-- (The rider's screen never even saw the 5: its mapper reads pickup_eta_minutes / eta /
-- pickup_eta, none of which is a column, so it fell back to a haversine against the
-- captain's live presence point when one happened to be loaded, and to "---" otherwise.)
--
--
-- THE FIX
--
-- Stamp the anchor, and keep the distance the server has already measured. Both are done
-- with triggers rather than by rewriting the two RPCs: submit_ride_offer is ~200 lines of
-- pricing logic that has nothing to do with this, and a trigger also covers the other paths
-- that write these rows (server.ts, the Cloud Functions in functions/src/handlers/trips.ts)
-- instead of only the one RPC.
