-- Favouriting a captain was stored per TRIP, on one device, and never reached the server.
--
-- Two symptoms, one cause. Reported from the rider's trip history: the same captain appears
-- three times, only one row shows a filled heart — and the captain still sees
-- "مش في مفضلته".
--
-- What the code actually did:
--
--   dexieDb.favoriteCaptains.where('tripId')          keyed by TRIP, not captain
--   favoriteCaptains.some(f => f.tripId === trip.tripId)   matched by TRIP, so only the one
--                                                          row that was tapped lights up
--   the history heart wrote Dexie + localStorage only    the server learned nothing
--
-- So "favourite" was really "I tapped a heart on this one receipt, in this one browser".
--
-- But favouriting is about a PERSON. A rider who favourites a captain means it for every trip
-- they have taken with them and every trip to come, on any device — and the captain is
-- supposed to be able to see it, which is impossible while the record never leaves the phone.
--
-- The rating modal did write reviews.gave_heart, which is why the captain's card worked at
-- all in testing but not from the history screen. One of the two places that set a favourite
-- told the server; the other did not.
--
--
-- THE FIX
--
-- A real table keyed by (rider, captain). reviews.gave_heart stays as the historical record
-- of "this rider hearted this captain when rating that trip" and is backfilled into here, so
-- no existing favourite is lost.
