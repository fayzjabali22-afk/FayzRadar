/**
 * The name of the place the destination pin is actually sitting on.
 *
 * The destination label was built only from the governorate/district dropdown, or from a
 * pasted Google link — never from the pin. So a rider who dragged the pin to Cairo still saw
 * "سادس من أكتوبر - الجيزة", because the label followed the dropdown while the coordinates,
 * the distance and the fare all followed the pin. Two sources of truth for one destination,
 * and only one of them moved when the rider moved it.
 *
 * Reverse-geocoded through Nominatim, which this app already uses for the rider's own
 * address and inside /api/maps/resolve — free, and no new dependency.
